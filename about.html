        <h1>✨ How it Started</h1>
        <section>
            <div>
                <p>
                    It started with a formal discussion around the drawing room — an evening filled with ideas, <br>
                    dreams, and creativity. During that conversation, my brother-in-law suggested starting something
                    <br> unique: a ready-to-wear saree brand that makes traditional draping effortless for modern women.
                    <br> That simple idea sparked the birth of SareeKraft.

                    What began as a family discussion soon turned <br> into a passion-driven journey. We wanted to
                    redefine how women experience sarees — keeping the <br> grace of tradition while adding the comfort
                    of innovation. With that vision, SareeKraft was created <br> to blend heritage, style, and
                    convenience into every design.

                    Today, SareeKraft stands as a proud <br> reflection of that humble beginning — where one thoughtful
                    idea turned into a beautiful movement <br> to make sarees simpler, smarter, and more stylish for
                    everyone.
